> _Planet Six_ is a newly discovered planet, on which Earth has launched a colonizing expedition. Players are part of the first crew sent down there to colonize and study the planet. However, since the arrival of humans on this planet, a lot of natural disasters start happening, and the players are sent to find out why the ecosystem of this planet is acting this way. Inspired from a few other game series, such as Borderlands and Monster Hunter World, _Planet Six_ is an online multiplayer cooperative RPG game where players must brave storms and defeat the boss at the center of it. Storms can take multiple shapes and affect players differently. Various natural disasters occur on the planet and the players must brave them in order to stop them. The storms are a difficult challenge, and players must work together to defeat the source and end the disaster before it reaches the colony.
